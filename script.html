    <p>In computing, a <b>script</b> is a relatively short and simple set of instructions that typically automate an otherwise manual process. The act of writing a script is called scripting. <b> Scripting language</b> or script language describes a programming language that it is used for a script.</p>

        Scripts are usually interpreted rather than compiled.
        
    <p>  Notable environments that are scriptable, can be automated via script, include application software, text editor, web page, operating system, embedded system, and computer game.</p>
        
    <p>Although any language could be used for scripting, in practice languages tend to either be used for scripting or for application development. But, some are used for both.</p>
